# Gamescope Headless Apps Configuration
# ============================================================================
# Simple list of commands to launch in the background when Gamescope starts.
# One command per line. Lines starting with # are comments.
#
# Apps are launched via xvfb-run (virtual X11 display) so they run invisibly.
# Commands are executed as-is - no shell evaluation.
#
# Location: /etc/gamescope-apps.conf (system default, part of image)
# Override: ~/.config/gamescope/apps.conf (user override, optional)
#
# To disable all apps: touch ~/.config/gamescope/disable-apps
# To customize apps: cp /etc/gamescope-apps.conf ~/.config/gamescope/apps.conf
#                    then edit ~/.config/gamescope/apps.conf
